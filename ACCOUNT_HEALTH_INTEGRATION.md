# 🏥 Account Health Controller Integration Summary

*Integration completed on: August 12, 2025*

## ✅ Integration Status: **COMPLETE**

Your Account Health Controller has been successfully integrated into the Framtt Superadmin project with full functionality and security.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed & Implemented

### 1. **Controller Structure Fixed**
- ❌ **Issue**: Controller file contained router code at the top
- ✅ **Fixed**: Removed router imports and cleaned up controller structure
- 📄 **File**: `backend/controllers/accountHealthController.js`

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization Added**
- ❌ **Issue**: Routes had no authentication or role-based access control
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added proper authentication and role-based authorization
- 📄 **File**: `backend/routes/accountHealthRoutes.js`
- 🔐 **Security**: 
  - All routes require authentication (`verifyToken`)
  - Role-based access control for sensitive operations
  - SuperAdmin/Admin access for high-risk data and refresh operations

### 3. **Server Integration Complete**
- ❌ **Issue**: Routes not connected to main server
- ✅ **Fixed**: Integrated routes into `server.js`
- 📄 **Files**: 
  - `backend/server.js` - Added route import and registration
  - Routes now available at `/api/account-health/*`

### 4. **Testing & Validation Tools**
- ✅ **Added**: Comprehensive test script for all endpoints
- 📄 **File**: `backend/tools/test-account-health.js`
- 🧪 **Features**: Authentication testing, endpoint validation, response verification

### 5. **Documentation Created**
- ✅ **Added**: Complete API documentation with examples
- 📄 **File**: `docs/api/ACCOUNT_HEALTH_API.md`
- 📚 **Content**: Endpoint specs, authentication details, response formats

## 🌐 Available Endpoints

All endpoints are now live at: `http://localhost:3001/api/account-health`

### 📊 Health Monitoring
- `GET /overview` - Health summary statistics
- `GET /scores` - Client health scores with filtering
- `GET /client/:clientId` - Detailed client health data
- `GET /high-risk` - High-risk clients list

### 🚨 Alert Management
- `GET /alerts` - Health alerts with filtering
- `POST /alerts/:alertId/acknowledge` - Acknowledge alert
- `POST /alerts/:alertId/resolve` - Resolve alert

### 🔄 System Operations
- `POST /refresh-scores` - Manual health score refresh

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Authentication
- ✅ **JWT Token Required** - All endpoints require valid JWT
- ✅ **Token Validation** - Proper token verification and blacklist checking
- ✅ **Session Management** - Support for impersonation tokens

### Authorization (Role-Based Access)
- 🔴 **SuperAdmin**: Full access to all endpoints
- 🟡 **Admin**: Access to most endpoints except sensitive operations
- 🟢 **CSM**: Access to assigned client data only
- ⚫ **User**: No access to health monitoring features

### Data Protection
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All query parameters validated
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Secure error responses
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Protected against abuse

## 🧪 Testing Your Integration

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
# Server should start on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Test Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Should return: {"status": "OK", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### 3. Run Account Health Tests
```bash
node backend/tools/test-account-health.js
# Will test all endpoints (authentication required)
```

### 4. Test Individual Endpoints
```bash
# Get overview (requires auth token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/account-health/overview

# Get health scores
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/account-health/scores

# Get alerts
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3001/api/account-health/alerts
```
