```

#### Existing CSM Assignment Endpoints
```
POST   /api/accounts/:id/assign-csm                      # Assign CSM to account
DELETE /api/accounts/:id/csm/:csmId                      # Remove CSM from account

```

### 6. Business Logic Implementation ✅

#### Assignment Rules
- **CSM Assignment**: Only 'csm' role users can be assigned to accounts
- **User Assignment**: Only 'user' role users can be assigned to customer accounts
- **Multiple Assignments**: Support for users/CSMs assigned to multiple accounts
- **Role Within Account**: Users have specific roles (owner, admin, member, viewer)
- **Primary CSM**: Support for designating primary CSM per account

#### Data Integrity
- Audit logging for all assignment operations
- Soft deletion to prevent data loss
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate assignments
- Upsert operations handle conflicts gracefully
